### Introduction
The **emergency record** contains all the important medical information needed in situations in which quick access or a quick overview of medical data is required. For example, in cases of unconsciousness, language barriers or limited health literacy.   
The emergency record combines key administrative and clinical data such as patient details, emergency contacts, medication, allergies, vaccinations, implants, diagnose, CPR status and references to living wills and other relevant documents.

The CH EMR implementation guide describes the FHIR representation of the electronic emergency record in Switzerland. It is dependent on [CH Core](http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-core/index.html) and [CH Term](http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-term/index.html), which describe the Swiss-specific context, particularly in relation to the Swiss Electronic Patient Record (EPR).   
This implementation guide is based on the concept for the exchange format of the electronic emergency record ([de](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/upload/documents/Konzept_eNotfallpass_DE.pdf), [fr](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/upload/documents/Konzept_Notfallpass_FR.pdf)).

### Dependencies Overview
The CH EMR (Emergency Record) implementation guide builds upon several Swiss FHIR specifications. The following diagram illustrates the relationships between these implementation guides:

The **CH EMR** is primarily derived from the [CH IPS (International Patient Summary)](https://fhir.ch/ig/ch-ips/index.html), which provides the foundational clinical profiles for patient summaries in Switzerland. CH IPS itself is based on the international [IPS UV](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/) specification by HL7, ensuring cross-border interoperability.

Both CH EMR and CH IPS depend on [CH Core](https://fhir.ch/ig/ch-core/index.html), which defines the Swiss-specific base profiles (e.g. patient, practitioner, organization) including Swiss identifiers such as AHV, GLN and EPR-SPID. [CH Term](https://fhir.ch/ig/ch-term/index.html) provides the shared Swiss terminologies, value sets and code systems used across all Swiss FHIR implementation guides.

Where CH IPS profiles were available and applicable, CH EMR profiles inherit from them (e.g. Patient, Medication, AllergyIntolerance, Condition, Immunization). For emergency-specific content not covered by IPS — such as resuscitation status, emergency contacts, risk factors and disabilities — CH EMR defines its own profiles based on CH Core or FHIR base resources.

### Objective

The emergency report is designed to give medical professionals quick and structured access to a patient's most important medical information in emergency situations. However, this medical information can also be used in unforeseen patient contacts where, for example, language barriers exist or health literacy is limited.

### Content scope

#### Core units

* **Patient information**: Demographic data and contact information
* **Emergency contacts**: Family and trusted persons
* **Care Team**: Treating Health care professional
* **Resuscitation status**: Patient's wishes regarding resuscitation measures in emergency situations
* **Current medication**: Information and dosage of medications 
* **Vaccinations**: Current vaccinations
* **Allergies and intolerances**: Known allergic reactions and intolerances
* **Risk factors**: Risks relevant to treatment
* **Problem list**: Diagnoses and problems
* **Advance directive**: Information on advance directives or medical directives
* **Other documents**: Other documents like organ donor cards
* **Implants**: Medical devices
* **Pregnancy**: Current pregnancy information
* **Disability**: Information about disabilities
